    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Effective crowd management is essential to ensure public safety and improve visitors’ experience at large-scale events such as SAIL 2025 in Amsterdam. Without sufficient crowd monitoring, crowd managers may lack oversight of crowd densities, potentially increasing the risk of overcrowding and related safety incidents. Past tragedies, such as the Seoul Halloween Parade in 2022, Houston’s Astroworld Festival in 2021 and Germany’s Love Parade in 2010, underscore the importance of proactive crowd monitoring and prediction systems. This project, therefore, aims to develop an interactive dashboard that serves to aid the SAIL Crowd Monitoring Team (CMT) in making informed decisions in real-time to manage crowd levels effectively and efficiently. Beyond SAIL, this dashboard could also be a modular tool which can be implemented by other large-scale event organisers worldwide. This project is also part of the broader crowd management strategy and will be integrated with physical control measures to form a holistic solution to crowd management challenges. "
